# HTML CSS GIT Module 1 Challenge  
# Helping Horiseon

Horiseon is a marketing agency here to help you optimize your buisness through an accesible website. 

The motivation behind this project was to refactor the HTML and CSS to make the site more accessible. During this project I learned how to meet accessibility standards by using semantic HTML, image attributes, alt attributes, heading attributes, sequential order, etc.
